# Remember play position in iTunes and iPods/iPhones #
It used to be that one had to convert mp3 files to m4b format in order to have iTunes & iPods remember the playback position of an audiobook, a critical feature when dealing with multi-hour audiobooks. However, iTunes and iPods now feature the ability to remember the playback position of mp3 files too. Once you add the mp3 file to iTunes, follow these steps:
  1. Right-click the file
  1. Click "Get Info"
  1. Click the "Options" tab
  1. Check the "Remember playback position" check-box
  1. It is recommended that you also check the "Skip when shuffling" check-box as well
For easy access on my iPod, I like to list all my audiobooks with the Artist Name "Audiobooks", then put the author's name as the Album Name, and the book name as the Track Name.
