=Remember play position in iTunes and iPods/iPhones=
It used to be that one had to convert mp3 files to m4b format in order to have iTunes & iPods remember the playback position of an audiobook, a critical feature when dealing with multi-hour audiobooks. However, iTunes and iPods now feature the ability to remember the playback position of mp3 files too. Once you add the mp3 file to iTunes, follow these steps:
 # Right-click the file
 # Click "Get Info"
 # Click the "Options" tab
 # Check the "Remember playback position" check-box
 # It is recommended that you also check the "Skip when shuffling" check-box as well
For easy access on my iPod, I like to list all my audiobooks with the Artist Name "Audiobooks", then put the author's name as the Album Name, and the book name as the Track Name.
